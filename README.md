# Song-Recommender-K-Means-Clustering

This is a case study developed as part of the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
My main responsability as a Data Analyst was to improve and expand a music recommendation system for a company that provides music, art, literature and products recommendations to clients.

First, I extracted popular songs data from "Billboard Hot 100" and "RollingStone The 100 Best Songs of 2022" using Web scraping.

Then I create a collection of songs with their audio features information using Spotify's API​​.

Finally I used K-Means Clustering algorithm  to identify clusters on my dataset, so when the  user inputs a song, cluster to which the song belongs is returned and recommendation with a song from the same cluster is provided.

To select the optimal number of clusters (K) I have used the "Elbow" Method and the Silhouette Method.
